# CENG336-Embedded-Systems-Development

CENG 336 is an intermediate course in the design and implementation of software for embedded systems, starting with assembly language and concluding with C. 
Assembly language and controller architecture. Peripheral interfaces: A/D and D/A conversion, parallel and serial ports, interrupts and timers/counters. I/O bus architectures. Sensors and actuators. Design and analysis techniques. Real time operating systems.

# THE1
The purpose of this individual assignment is to familiarizing the basic I/O operations
and round-robin approach on PIC18F8722 using MPLAB X IDE simulation environment. To this
end, I implemented a device that is capable of rendering two kinds of progress bars using
LEDs according to the user input.

# THE2
A simple Tetris-like game. Using the basic interrupt operations and seven-segment display using PIC18F8722 microprocessor and the provided boards. 
The user will provide commands to move a Tetris piece and try to submit it on this
board in an appropriate position.

# THE3
In this assignment, I implemented the flight director program that runs on the most crucial
component of the autopilot system. The program calculates the travelled distance given the
speed throughout the flight and end the simulation when the remaining distance become 0. My
mission was to report the current situation of the aircraft by sending messages or to manipulate the
flight after receiving messages from the autopilot. My implementation is communicating
with the autopilot system through serial connection.
